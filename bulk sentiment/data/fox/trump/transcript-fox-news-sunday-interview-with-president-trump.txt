CHRIS WALLACE, FOX ANCHOR:  And hello again from Fox News in Washington.  Today from the White House, we're on the president's patio just outside the Oval Office.

President Trump, you've agreed to answer all manner of questions, no subject off-limits. Thank you and welcome back to "FOX NEWS SUNDAY."

DONALD TRUMP, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES:  Thank you very much.

WALLACE:  Let's start with the surge of the coronavirus across the country in recent months. You still talk about it as, quote, "burning embers." But I want to put up a chart that shows where we are with the illness over the last four months. As you can see, we hit a peak here in April, 36,000 cases...

 
TRUMP:  Cases.

WALLACE:  ... a day.

TRUMP:  Yes, cases.

WALLACE:  Then -- then it went down and now since June, it has gone up more than double. One day this week 75,000 new cases.  More than double...

TRUMP:  Chris, that's because we have great testing, because we have the best testing in the world. If we didn't test, you wouldn't be able to show that chart. If we tested half as much, those numbers would be down.

WALLACE:  But -- but this isn't burning embers, sir? This is a forest fire.

TRUMP:  No, no. But I don't say -- I say flames, we'll put out the flames. And we'll put out in some cases just burning embers. We also have burning embers. We have embers and we do have flames. Florida became more flame like, but it's -- it's going to be under control.

And, you know, it's not just this country, it’s many countries. We don't talk about it in the news. They don't talk about Mexico and Brazil and still parts of Europe, which actually got hit sooner than us, so it's a little ahead of us in that sense.

But you take a look, why don't they talk about Mexico?  Which is not helping us. And all I can say is thank God I built most of the wall, because if I didn't have the wall up we would have a much bigger problem with Mexico.

WALLACE:  But, sir, we have the seventh highest mortality rate in the world. Our mortality rate is higher than Brazil, it's higher than Russia and the European Union has us on a travel ban.

TRUMP:  Yeah. I think what we'll do -- well, we have them under travel ban too, Chris. I closed them off. If you remember, I was the one that did the European Union very early.

But when you talk about mortality rates, I think it's the opposite. I think we have one of the lowest mortality rates in the world.

WALLACE:  That’s not true, sir. We, we, we have a -- we had 900 deaths on a single day...

TRUMP:  We will take a look...

WALLACE:  ... just this week...

TRUMP:  Ready?

WALLACE:  You, you can check it out.

TRUMP:  Can you please get me the mortality rate?
